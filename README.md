# Java with Automation Foundations Project
# Story Pitch App

For this project, I created a full-stack application.
The biggest priority for this application is testing using (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium).

## About the Application

### SPMS: Story Pitch Management System

Story Pitch Management System is an application which allows authors to submit pitches for stories to the publishing company. They can write a small description of the story they hope to write, and editors can go into the application and approve or reject story pitches based on whether they sound interesting or even suggest changes before approval.

## Technologies Used:

1.  Java    
2.  Maven    
3.  Postgres   
4.  DBeaver
5.  Junit
6.  Mockito
7.  Selenium
8.  Cucumber/Gherkin
9.  HTML5 / CSS 3
10. Javascript / AJAX

## Technical Requirements

1. Data must be stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database (local or AWS).
2. Data access in Java will be performed using JDBC DAOs.
3. HTTP handling in Java will be done using Javalin.
4. Service layers must be fully unit tested using JUnit and Mockito.
5. DAOs are fully unit tested using JUnit.
6. Front end must be written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no libraries/frameworks for JS. Styling libraries like Bootstrap are fine).
7. At least one feature must have an automation test written using Selenium.

## Features
1. End2End testing using Junit and Mockito
2. Abilty to add user story pitch 
3. Signin function

Todo List
1. Fix bugs
2. Correct E2E 
3. Fix CSS flexbox
4. Correct failed unit testing
5. Add Cucumber Scenarios
